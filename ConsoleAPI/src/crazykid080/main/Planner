Plans:
Add a file logging system
Add a limiter to logging (only log level X and up, default is all)



Thought process:
1. Class X wants to write message Y to console.
2. Message Y gets sent to control.
3. Control checks log level to determine if log level is equal or greater than file logging setting
4. If it is, write to file as well as console.

Give each log level a int value?
