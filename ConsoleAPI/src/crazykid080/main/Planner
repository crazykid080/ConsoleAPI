Plans:
Add a file logging system SEMI DONE
Add a limiter to logging (only log level X and up, default is all) DONE

Thought process:
1. Class X wants to write message Y to console. 
2. Message Y gets sent to control. 
3. Control checks log level to determine if log level is equal or greater than file logging setting DONE
4. If it is, write to file as well as console. TO DO NEXT

Give each log level a int value? DONE
