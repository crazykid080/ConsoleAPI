# ConsoleAPI
The Console API I created.

This API will most likely be used in my later projects.

How to use:
Create a class that extends AdminCommandController.
 -If you can duplicate the class, great.
Override runCommand.
Add methods you wish to add.
 -Do this by
  -Creating a method that does what you want the command to do
  -Add it to the if statement list in runCommand.
